 * Choice button is a button which can be checked and belongs to "choice group" of
 * similar buttons and only one button from that group can be checked.
 * When some unchecked button is checked by the user the previously checked button
 * from the same choice group will be unchecked automatically. Well known example
 * of such button is a radio button.
