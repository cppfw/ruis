# Basic Info

*morda* uses concept of _Widgets_ for structuring the Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Common element of the GUI is called _Widget_ (window + gadget = widget). Basically, GUI is an hierarchy of widgets.
Simple widget represents a rectangular area on the screen, it can receive user input from mouse and keyboard.
There is a _Container_ widget, this is a widget which can contain child widgets. It manages positions of its child widgets,
dispatches user input to child widgets and renders them to screen.
Each child _Widget_ have pointer to its parent _Container_ widget. _Container_, in turn, is a _Widget_ itself.
Root widget of the hierarchy does not have parent _Container_.

The hierarchy of widgets can be described in GUI description scripts using link:http://stobml.org[STOB], a simple markup language.
The hierarchy of widget objects can be "inflated" from those GUI scripts.
